    Remove remote shell support from libc
    
    The remote shell facilities are past deprecation and there is an
    obligation to prevent their use rather than to support them. This patch
    removes the related function definitions from 'unistd.h', which have not
    been been included in the Genode libc ABI regardless.

NIC-router improvements
=======================

    nic_router: use local but individual MAC addresses
    
    IP stacks may treat a network interface as "down" when it states a MAC
    address with the I/G bit (bit 40) set to "Group" (value 0) instead of
    "Individual" (value 1). This was observed with a TinyCore 8 inside a
    Virtualbox VM. Thus, the previously choosen 03:03:03:03:03:00 as base
    for the MAC address allocator is bad. Now we use the 02:02:02:02:02:00
    instead. This also ensures that the MAC addresses are not marked as
    "Universal" but as "Local" (bit 41, value 1) which is correct in general
    as the router allocates MAC addresses only for virtual networks.

    nic_router: handle ARP requests for foreign IPs
    
    If the router has no gateway attribute for a domain (means that the router
    itself is the gateway), and it gets an ARP request for a foreign IP, it shall
    answer with its own IP.

    nic_router: dhcp server functionality
    
    One can configure the NIC router to act as DHCP server at interfaces of a
    domain by adding the <dhcp> tag to the configuration of the domain like
    this:
    
    <domain name="vbox" interface="10.0.1.1/24">
        <dhcp-server ip_first="10.0.1.80"
                     ip_last="10.0.1.100"
                     ip_lease_time_sec="3600"
                     dns_server="10.0.0.2"/>
        ...
    </domain>
    
    The attributes ip_first and ip_last define the available IPv4 address
    range while ip_lease_time_sec defines the lifetime of an IPv4 address
    assignment in seconds. The IPv4 address range must be in the subnet
    defined by the interface attribute of the domain tag and must not cover
    the IPv4 address in this attribute. The dns_server attribute gives the
    IPv4 address of the DNS server that might also be in another subnet.
    The lifetime of an offered assignment is the configured round trip time of
    the router while the ip_lease_time_sec is applied only if the offer is
    requested by the client in time.
    
    The ports/run/virtualbox_nic_router.run script is an example of how to
    use the new DHCP server functionality.

    nic_router: DHCP client functionality
    
    If the attribute 'interface' is not set in a 'domain' tag, the router tries to
    dynamically receive and maintain an IP configuration for that domain by using
    DHCP in the client role at all interfaces that connect to the domain. In the
    DHCP discover phase, the router simply chooses the first DHCP offer that
    arrives. So, no comparison of different DHCP offers is done. In the DHCP
    request phase, the server is expected to provide an IP address, a gateway, a
    subnet mask, and an IP lease time to the router. If anything substantial goes
    wrong during a DHCP exchange, the router discards the outcome of the exchange
    and goes back to the DHCP discover phase. At any time where there is no valid
    IP configuration present at a domain, the domain does only act as DHCP client
    and all other router functionality is disabled for the domain. A domain cannot
    act as DHCP client and DHCP server at once. So, a 'domain' tag must either
    have an 'interface' attribute or must not contain a 'dhcp-server' tag.
    
    Ref #2534


New driver-manager subsystem
============================

In traditional Genode system scenarios, the selection and configuration of the
used device drivers are defined at system-integration time. This approach
works fine whenever the hardware platform targeted by a given scenario and the
use case of the scenario is well known in advance. But it does not scale up to
general-purpose computing where one system image must be usable on diverse
machines, and the concrete use cases are up to the end user.

The new _driver-manager_ subsystem composes existing Genode components within
a dynamic subsystem that spawns and configures device drivers that are
fundamental for an interactive system on demand. It provides the following
feature set:

* It contains the ACPI-discovery component and the platform driver.

* It hosts and automatically configures the USB driver such that USB storage
  and vendor-specific devices become available to user-specific driver
  components residing outside the drivers subsystem (e.g., a VirtualBox
  instance that drives an individual USB stick). The list of present USB
  devices and the current USB-driver configuration are provided as a
  'usb_devices' and 'usb_drv.config' report respectively.

* It spawns the AHCI driver and produces a list of present devices as a
  'block_devices' report.

* It hosts a PS/2 driver as well as an input-filter that incorporates the
  input-event streams originating from the PS/2 and USB HID drivers. The
  default configuration generates character events based on a configurable
  keyboard layout and repeat, and includes scroll-wheel emulation and pointer
  acceleration for a PS/2 mouse (or, more importantly, the trackpoint of
  Lenovo laptops),

* It responds to changes of the 'capslock' and 'numlock' states, which are
  managed by the outside of the drivers subsystem. Both states are consumed
  by the USB and PS/2 drivers to driver the keyboard-indicator LEDs. The
  'numlock' state is furthermore used to toggle key remappings performed by
  the input filter. The 'capslock' state is incorporated into the modifier
  state as processed by the input-filter's character generator.

The new subsystem comes in the form of a depot package, which depends on all
requires components. Internally, it employs a dynamic init instance as a tool
to start and manage driver components on demand. The actual management
component is a simple program of about 500 lines of code that merely consumes
reports and produces configurations. It is so simple that it does not even
perform any dynamic memory allocation.

The new subsystem is present in the _gems_ repository and illustrated by the
_gems/run/driver_manager.run_ script. It is also used as one cornerstone of
the forthcoming general-purpose "sculpt" scenario mentioned in the
introduction.


Configuration changes of acpica and platform driver
===================================================

    acpica: request 'Acpi' only if 'acpi_ready="yes"'
    
    The synchronization with the ACPI driver is not needed when starting
    acpica at a later stage. It could already be disabled via the
    'acpi_ready="yes"' config attribute. However, acpica still
    unconditionally requests the so-called "Acpi" service, which is an
    alias for the platform_drv's "Platform" service. This patch disables the
    use of this alias when the 'acpi_ready' synchronization is disabled.

    platform_drv: separate acpi and system feature


New ROM-filter abilities
========================

The ROM-filter components is able to transform XML data from multiple ROM
modules into a new ROM module. It is prominently used to generate component
configurations depending on global system state. The current release makes
this tool more flexible by allowing verbatim copies of input content into
the output XML node as well as the use of input content as attribute values.


New user-input processing capabilities
======================================

In [https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/17.02#Input-event_filter - version 17.02],
we introduced a modular input-processing component called _input-filter_.
The current release adds the following features to this component:

:incorporating modifier state from external ROMs:

  By adding a '<rom name="...">' node into '<modN>' node of a chargen-filter,
  it is now possible to incorporate the content of the given ROM module into
  the modifier state. If the ROM module contains a top-level node with the
  attribute 'enabled' set to "yes", the modifier is enabled. This is useful
  for handling a system-global capslock state.

:scroll-wheel emulation:

  The new '<button-scroll>' filter turns relative motion events into wheel
  events while a special button (i.e., the middle mouse button) is pressed.
  The button and rate of generated wheel events can be configured per axis via
  the sub nodes '<vertical>' and '<horizontal>'. The button of each axis can
  be specified via the 'button' attribute. By default, "BTN_MIDDLE" is used.
  The rate of generated wheel events can be defined by the 'speed_percent'
  attribute. A value of "100" uses relative motion vectors directly as wheel
  motion vectors. In practice, this is results in overly fast wheel motion. By
  lowering the value, the rate can be reduced to practical levels. By
  specifying a negative value, the direction of the generated wheel motion can
  be inverted.

  The consumed relative motion events are filtered out from the event stream
  such that pointer movements are inhibited while the wheel emulation is
  active. All other events are passed along unmodified.

:pointer acceleration:

  The new '<accelerate>' filter applies acceleration to relative motion
  values. The 'max' attribute defines the maximum value added to the incoming
  motion values. The 'sensitivity_percent' attribute scales incoming motion
  values before applying the (potentially non-linear) acceleration function.
  The 'curve' attribute defines the degree of non-linearity of the
  acceleration. The value "0" corresponds to a linear function whereas the
  maximum value "255" applies a curved function. The default value is "127".


Keyboard-LED support for PS/2 and USB HID
=========================================

Both the PS/2 and the USB drivers have gained the new '<config>' attributes
'capslock_led="no"', 'numlock_led="no"', and 'scrlock_led="no"' (with their
default values shown). The attributes can have the values "no" (LED is turned
off), "yes" (LED is turned on), or "rom". In the latter case, the driver reads
the LED state from a dedicated ROM module called "capslock", "numlock", or
"scrlock" respectively. The ROM module is expected to have a top-level XML
node with the attribute 'enabled' set to "yes" or "no". The drivers reflect
this state information by driving the corresponding keyboard-mode indicator
LEDs.


Revised nitpicker GUI server

    nit_fb: support 'origin' attribute
    
    This patch makes the specification of screen coordinates more flexible.
    First, the 'origin' attribute allows one to refer to either of the four
    screen corners without knowing the screen size. Second, the 'width'
    and 'height' values now accept negative values, which are relative to
    the screen size.

    nitpicker: re-organize implementation
    
    This patch revises the implementation of nitpicker in the following
    respects:
    
    - Split the implementation into smaller files,
    - Consistently use the 'Nitpicker' namespace,
    - Avoid the use of format strings,
    - Retire old (and hackish) debug mode,
    - Removal of unused timer connection,
    - Merging 'Session' into 'Session_component',
    - Merging 'Mode' into 'User_state',
    - Adding the notions of 'View_owner' and 'Focus' as interfaces,
    - Untangle 'User_state' and 'View_stack'

    nitpicker: respond to external focus policy
    
    This patch enables nitpicker to use an external focus policy instead of
    the traditional builtin click-to-focus policy. The external focus policy
    is obtained from a 'focus' ROM. The focus ROM is expected to have a
    'label' attribute with the value set to the label of the to-be focused
    client.

    nitpicker: equip hover report with 'active' info
    
    This patch supplements the existing 'hover' report with the information
    whether or not the user has recently moved the pointer. This works
    analogously to how the 'focus' report features the information about
    recent button/keyboard activity.
    
    Together, the 'hover' and 'focus' reports may be combined to observe
    prolonged user inactivity, e.g. to activate a lock screen.

    hw: introduce kernel/user address space split
    
    * introduces central memory map for core/kernel
    * on 32-bit platforms the kernel/core starts at 0x80000000
    * on 64-bit platforms the kernel/core starts at 0xffffffc000000000
    * mark kernel/core mappings as global ones (tagged TLB)
    * move the exception vector to begin of core's binary,
      thereby bootstrap knows from where to map it appropriately
    * do not map boot modules into core anymore
    * constrain core's virtual heap memory area
    * differentiate in between user's and core's main thread's UTCB,
      which now resides inside the kernel segment

    hw: use x86 exception stack unconditionally
    
    Always switch to the "exception stack" instead of having a hardware initiated
    stack switch during exceptions/interrupts when the privilege level changes only.
    Moreover, this commit increases the exception stack slightly.

    hw: switch page-tables only when necessary
    
    * Instead of always re-load page-tables when a thread context is switched
      only do this when another user PD's thread is the next target,
      core-threads are always executed within the last PD's page-table set
    * remove the concept of the mode transition
    * instead map the exception vector once in bootstrap code into kernel's
      memory segment
    * when a new page directory is constructed for a user PD, copy over the
      top-level kernel segment entries on RISCV and X86, on ARM we use a designated
      page directory register for the kernel segment
    * transfer the current CPU id from bootstrap to core/kernel in a register
      to ease first stack address calculation
    * align cpu context member of threads and vms, because of x86 constraints
      regarding the stack-pointer loading
    * introduce Align_at template for members with alignment constraints
    * let the x86 hardware do part of the context saving in ISS, by passing
      the thread context into the TSS before leaving to user-land
    * use one exception vector for all ARM platforms including Arm_v6
