Sculpt OS on 64-bit ARM hardware (i.MX8 EVK)
############################################

Within the last year, a lot of effort was put into Genode's support for ARM
64-bit hardware. A consequent next step was to port Sculpt OS to the i.MX8 EVK
board, which we used so far as reference platform. With the current release,
we proudly present the first incarnation of Sculpt OS for this board.

In contrast to the original x86 PC variant, this first ARM version ships with a
static set of devices inside the drivers subsystem. No device manager component
probes for the used hardware and starts drivers on demand. Instead, the set of drivers
defined in the _drivers_managed-imx8q_evk_ package enables USB HID devices to
make use of mouse and keyboard peripherals connected to the board. It drives the
SD-card, which can be used as storage back end for Genode's depot package
management. Finally, it contains drivers to manage the display engine and the
platform's device resources.

With Sculpt OS for ARM 64-bit, we not only aim for classical desktop/notebook
systems - like on x86 - but also for embedded consumer hardware like phones and
tablets. In order to leverage this goal, we enabled support for
[https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i-mx-8-series-accessory-boards:i.MX8-ACCESSORY-BOARDS - NXP's MX8_DSI_OLED1]
display on the i.MX8 platform on Genode. The panel features an OLED display as well
as a Synaptics RMI4 compliant touch screen.

Genode's i.MX8 display driver that we released with version
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/20.02#Display_engine - 20.02]
supported HDMI devices only, whereas the OLED display is connected via
[https://www.mipi.org/specifications/dsi - MIPI DSI] to the SoC. Therefore, we
extended the display driver by the MIPI DSI infrastructure as well as the actual
driver for the OLED display. This endeavour turned out to be a very rocky one,
which we have documented in detail on our
[https://genodians.org/ssumpf/2020-09-30-mipi_touch - Genodians] website.

[image imx8_oled]

In order to enable the touch screen device, we implemented a new Genode
component from scratch. The touch screen is connected via an I2C bus to the SoC
where data can be sent to and received from. At the moment, the I2C
implementation is hidden within the driver but as more devices require I2C
access, it will eventually become a standalone component. Interrupts are delivered
via GPIO pins from the touch screen to the SoC, which made it necessary to
enable i.MX8 support within Genode's generic i.MX GPIO driver. We took this as
an opportunity to streamline, cleanup, and make the driver more robust.
Additionally, all driver components now take advantage of the new platform driver API
for ARM that has been introduced with release
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/20.05#New_platform_driver_for_the_ARM_universe - 20.05].

In its current incarnation, the driver for the display management is not able to
switch in between HDMI or MIPI-DSI connected displays dynamically. Therefore,
the display to be used in Sculpt has to be configured in the framebuffer configuration
manually. By default the HDMI connector is used.

Beyond the driver subsystem, there are few components dependent on the actual
hardware, which is why the look & feel of the Sculpt desktop does not actually
differ from the x86 PC version, with the following exceptions:

When you select the network configuration dialog, you'll have no "Wifi" option
because of the missing hardware. However, the "wired" option allows you to start the
corresponding driver for the i.MX FEC Ethernet device. The second difference to
the Sculpt OS x86 PC variant is the absence of a virtual machine solution for now.
Although Genode comprises a mature virtual-machine-monitor solution for ARM - see
Section [Multicore virtualization on ARM] - it still lacks a reasonable
storage back end. Therefore, we left it out for now. Lastly, there is no
possibility to use USB block devices by now, because the required management
component - a driver manager for i.MX8 - does not exist yet. We plan to bridge
these remaining few gaps compared to the x86 version with the upcoming Genode
releases.

To give Sculpt a try on the i.MX8 EVK board, you have to start the well-known
Sculpt run-script as usual, but for the base-hw kernel. For example:

!  tool/create_builddir arm_v8a
!  cd build/arm_v8a
!  make run/sculpt KERNEL=hw BOARD=imx8q_evk

Under the hood, the run script requests a sculpt-<board> specific package from
the depot package system. Currently, _sculpt-pc_ and _sculpt-imx8q_evk_ are
available.


Multicore virtualization on ARM
###############################

The written-from-scratch virtualization solution for Genode on ARMv8 entered the
picture exactly one year ago with
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/19.11#Virtualization_of_64-bit_ARM_platforms - release 19.11].
Since then, a couple of
improvements and validations have been incorporated into it. Support for VirtIO
network and console models was added. Moreover, it got streamlined with our prior
existing ARMv7 hypervisor and virtual-machine monitor (VMM). But although the
architecture of the VMM was designed from the very beginning with more than one
virtual-CPU (VCPU) in mind, running a VM on multiple cores was not addressed,
nor tested yet.

With this release, we enhance the virtualization support of the base-hw kernel,
acting as the ARM hypervisor, to support multicore virtual machines. The
VMM implementation got extended to start an entrypoint for each VCPU owned by
a VM. The affinities of those entrypoints are configured to distribute over all
physical CPUs available to the VMM. The affinity of an entrypoint that handles
events of a VCPU is automatically used as the affinity of the VCPU itself.
Whenever a VCPU exit needs to be handled, this is delegated to the VMM entrypoint
running on the same CPU. Once the VMM's entrypoint successfully handled the exit
reason, it starts the VCPU again.

Formerly, the control to start or stop a VCPU was implemented by core's VM
service that runs on the first CPU. But that implied that all different VMM
entrypoints running on distinct CPUs would have needed to frequently call
core's service entrypoint on the first CPU, inducing costly cross-CPU
communication. This is amplified by the fact that core's entrypoint uses
a system call to instruct the kernel's internal scheduler of the corresponding
target CPU, which again would potentially target a remote CPU.
For simplifying the implementation and for improving performance, we slightly extended the
VM-session interface to return a kernel-specific capability addressing a
VCPU directly. With this capability, a VMM's entrypoint is able to directly call
the kernel to start or stop a VCPU instead of using the indirection over core.
However, the detail whether the kernel is called directly or not is hidden
behind the VM session client API and transparent to the user of it.


Base framework and OS-level infrastructure
##########################################

C runtime
=========

We improved the support for aligned memory allocations to fix sporadic memory
leaks, which occurred with our port of the Falkon web browser. One relevant
change is the implementation of the 'posix_memalign()' function, another
change is that the address alignment of anonymous 'mmap()' allocations is now
configurable like follows:

! <config>
!     <libc>
!         <mmap align_log2="21"/>
!     </libc>
! </config>


Standard C++ library
====================

Even though Genode uses C++ as its primary programming language,
we do not rely on or make use of any C++ standard library within the Genode
OS framework.
However, since a C++ STL is a vital part of application programming with C++,
naturally we provide one for applications built ontop of the base framework;
in particular the GNU C++ STL library (_libstdc++_).
It is treated as a regular 3rd party library and its functionality
is extended on demand. This approach worked well enough to even enable larger
C++-based software like Qt5 and Chromium's Blink engine (as part of QtWebEngine)
to run on Genode. That being said, for developers using _libstdc++_ on Genode,
it is not immediately clear, which features are supported and which are not.

Fortunately, _libstdc++_ includes a testsuite that - as the name suggests -
allows for testing the range of functionality of the library on a given
platform. So we turned to it to establish a base line of supported features.
We were particular interested in how our port behaves when C++17 is
requested. It goes without saying that this only includes the aspects,
which are specifically probed by the testsuite. Rather than adding thorough
Genode support to the testsuite, we opted for providing an
[https://github.com/cnuke/genode-libstdcxx-testsuite/ - environment] that
mimicks the common 'unix' target and allows us to execute the testsuite on
the Linux version of Genode via a regular Linux host OS. It uses the Genode
tool chain to compile the tests and spawns a Genode base-linux system to
execute them.

Executing the testsuite was an iterative process because in the beginning, we
encountered many falsely failed tests. On one hand, most of them were due to
the way C++ is applied in Genode or rather how our buildsystem works
internally. For one, _libsupc++_ on Genode is part of the _cxx_ library. This
library in turn is part of _ldso.lib.so_, the dynamic linker that provides
the base API. As the buildsystem uses stub libraries generated from 'symbol'
files containing the ABI of a given shared object, each missing symbol must
be made available. Otherwise the linking step is going to fail complaining
about undefined references because components use these stub libraries
during compilation. On the other hand, we had to get cozy with the testsuites
underlying test framework in order to get our test environment straight.

In case of the testsuite, there were a lot of symbols missing because we
did not encounter them so far and those were therefore not part of the
symbols file. After all, templates will always generate specific symbols
that are difficult to forsee. Besides that, we lacked support for aligned
'new' and 'delete' operators. With these adaptions in place, we were able to
successfully execute the testsuite.

In the end, the results paint a good picture. The current short-comings
boil down to

* Support for the *stdc++fs* library is not available as the library is
  not ported yet.
* Proper *locale* support in the 'libc' as well as 'stdc++' is not available.
* Support for parallel operations with *openmp* is not available.
* Various subsystems ('std::thread', 'std::random_device', numerics library)
  need further attention for proper functionality. This is most prominent
  for the failing execution tests where sometimes the threads appear to
  get stuck.

These findings are documented at issue
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3925 - 3925].


Consistent Block Encrypter (CBE)
================================

The CBE is a library for the management of encrypted block-devices that is
entirely written in SPARK. It was first announced and integrated with
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/19.11#Preliminary_block-device_encrypter - Genode 19.11],
reached feature-completeness with
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/20.05#Feature-completeness_of_the_consistent_block_encrypter - Genode 20.05],
and has received a highly modular back-end system with version
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/20.08#Consistent_Block_Encrypter - 20.08].
For this release, we thoroughly steamlined the CBE repository, added enhanced
automated quality assurance, and switched to another default encryption
back end.


Repository restructuring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally speaking, the [https://github.com/m-stein/cbe - CBE repository] has
been freed from everything that is not either part of the SPARK-based core
logic (cbe, cbe_common, and the hashing algorithm), the essential SPARK-based
tooling (initialization, checking, ...), or the Ada-based C++ bindings (*_cxx
libraries). The whole Genode-specific integration, testing, and packaging moved
to Genode's 'gems' repository and the former Genode sub-repository 'cbe' was
replaced by the new CBE port _gems/ports/cbe.port_. We also took the
opportunity to remove many unused remnants of earlier development stages and
to drastically simplify the ecosystem of CBE-related packages.

We hope that this allows for certain characteristics of the CBE project, like
its strong OS-independence or a completely "flow-mode"-provable core logic
to become more clear, while at the same time, the Genode-specific accessories
can benefit from being part of the Genode mainline development.


Automated testing, benchmarking, and proving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CBE tester is a scriptable environment meant for testing all aspects of the
CBE library and its basic tooling. Through its XML command interface, one can
not only access and validate data of CBE devices but also initialize them,
check their consistency, analyze their meta data, execute performance
benchmarks, manage device snapshots, perform online re-keying or online
re-dimensioning of devices, and, last but not least, manage the required Trust
Anchors.

Before this release, the CBE tester was a mere patchwork solution and many of
the above mentioned features were limited or even missing. For instance block
access was issued only synchronous, the Trust-Anchor was managed implicitly,
and validating read data wasn't possible. Besides adding the missing features,
we also reworked the component entirely to follow a clean and comprehensible
implementation concept. The new CBE tester comes together with the run script
_gems/run/cbe_tester.run_ that shall serve as both a demonstration how to use
the tester and an extensive automated test and benchmark for the CBE.

Furthermore, we created a CBE-specific autopilot tool _tool/cbe_autopilot_ that
is meant to establish a common reference for the quality of CBE releases as
well as for their integration in Genode. Running the tool without arguments
will give instructions how to use it. In a nutshell, when running
'tool/cbe_autopilot basics', the tool will GNAT-prove what is expected to be
provable, run all CBE-related run scripts expected to work, and build all
CBE-related packages (existing build and depot directories are not touched in
this process). The idea is to make this succeed each time before advancing the
master branch of the CBE repository or releasing a new version of the
integration in Genode. A handy side-feature of the tool is that one can run
'tool/cbe_autopilot prove' to do only the GNAT-proving part. With
'tool/cbe_autopilot clean' finally, the tool cleans up all of its artifacts.


Libcrypto back end for block encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The introduction of VFS plugins for CBE back ends in the previous Genode release
made it much easier to interchange concrete implementations. This motivated us
to play around a bit in our endeavour of optimizing execution time. It turned
out that especially the choice of the block-encryption back end has a
significant impact on the overall performance of CBE block operations. It
furthermore seemed that especially the 'libsparkcrypto' library, our former
default for block encryption, prioritizes other qualities over performance.

That said, in general, we want to enable an informed user to decide for him- or
herself which qualities one prefers in such an algorithm. The VFS plugin
mechanism pays tribute to this. And it also seems very natural to us to combine
a SPARK-based block-device management with a SPARK-based encryption back-end
like 'libsparkcrypto'. But for our default use case, we came to the conclusion
that the 'libcrypto' library might be a better choice.


Streamlined ioctl handling in the C runtime / VFS
=================================================

The Genode release
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/19.11#C_runtime_with_improved_POSIX_compatibility - 19.11]
introduced the emulation of ioctl operations via pseudo files. This feature
was first used by the Terminal. With the current release, we further employ this
mechanism for additional ioctl operations, like the block-device related
I/O controls, as the long-term plan is to remove the notion of ioctl's from
the 'Vfs::File_io_services' API all-together.

We therefore equipped the block VFS-plugin with a compound directory hosting
the pseudo files for triggering device operations:

:info: This file contains the device information structured as 'block'
  XML node having an 'size' and 'count' attribute providing the used
  block size as well as the total number of blocks.

:block_count: contains solely the total number of blocks.

:block_size: contains solely the size of one block in bytes.

Furthermore, we split the existing 'ioctl' handling method in the libc into
specific ones for dealing with terminals and block devices because at some
point more different groups of I/O controls are to follow.

The first one to follow is the 'SNDCTL' group. This group deals with audio
devices and corresponds to the standard set by the OpenSoundSystem (OSS)
specfication years ago. In the same vein as the terminal and block I/O
controls, the sound controls are implemented via property files.

The controls currently implemented are the ones used by the output OSS
plugin of [https://cmus.github.io/ - cmus], the driving factor behind the
implementation, which uses the (obsolete) version 3 API.

At the moment, it is not possible to set or rather change any
parameters. In case the requested setting differs from the parameters
of the underlying audio-out session - in contrast to the suggestion in
the OSS manual - we do not silently adjust the parameters returned
to the callee but let the I/O control operation fail.

The following list contains all currently handled SNDCTL I/O controls:

:SNDCTL_DSP_CHANNELS: sets the number of channels. We return the
  available channels here and return ENOTSUP if it differs from
  the requested number of channels.

:SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE: returns amount of playback data that can
  be written without blocking. For now it amounts the space left
  in the stream buffer of the audio-out session.

:SNDCTL_DSP_POST: forces playback to start. We do nothing and return
  success.

:SNDCTL_DSP_RESET: is supposed to reset the device when it is
  active before any parameters are changed. We do nothing and return
  success.

:SNDCTL_DSP_SAMPLESIZE: sets the sample size. We return the
  sample size of the underlying audio-out session and return ENOTSUP
  if it differs from the requested number of channels.

:SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT: sets the buffer size hint. We ignore the
  hint and return success.

:SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED: sets the sample rate. For now, we always return
  the rate of the underlying audio out session and return ENOTSUP
  if it differs from the requested one.

The libc extension is accompanied by an OSS VFS plugin that gives
access to a audio-out session by roughly implementing a OSS
pseudo-device. It merely wraps the session and does not provide any
form of resampling or re-coding of the audio stream.

[image cmus]

Image [cmus] shows how the various pieces work together in a real-world
scenario. The interplay of the extended libc with the OSS VFS plugin allows
for listing to MP3s - for the time being the format is restricted to
44.1kHz/16bit - on Sculpt using the [https://cmus.github.io/ - cmus]
audio player.

The current state serves as a starting point for further implementing the OSS
API to cover more use cases, especially with ported POSIX software like
VirtualBox and Qt5 or even as SDL2 audio back end. After all, even showing its
age, OSS still is supported by the majority of middle ware and makes for a
decent experimentation target.


Device drivers
##############

VirtIO support
==============

Thanks to the remarkable contribution by Piotr Tworek, the Genode OS framework
has become able to drive VirtIO network devices.

He did not only provide a single VirtIO network driver but a framework to
easily add more VirtIO driver classes in the future. Either the devices are
connected as PCI devices or directly as platform devices with fixed
memory-mapped I/O addresses. The framework supports both and abstracts away from
the concrete connection type.

The VirtIO network driver enables networking for Genode when using the
'virt_qemu' board on either the ARMv7a or ARMv8a architecture. However, the
VirtIO device configuration on Qemu is dynamic. The order and presence of
different command line switches affect the bus address and interrupt assignment
of each device. To make the use of Genode with Qemu robust in changing
environments, a tiny helper component was supplemented. This component named
'virtdev_rom' probes the memory-mapped I/O areas of the system bus and detects
available and known VirtIO devices. The results are provided in the form of a
configuration that can be consumed by the platform driver to assign the correct device
resources to the corresponding VirtIO driver.

The VirtIO network driver in action, as well as the interplay of the platform driver
and the 'virtdev_rom' component can be observed when using the
'drivers_nic-virt_qemu' package.


Improved support for OpenBSD audio drivers
==========================================

So far, the supported drivers exclusively used PCI as transport bus and for
practical reasons, the emulation environment was to tied to it. The bus
handling has now moved into its own compilation unit to make future addition
of drivers that employ other transport busses easier. On the same account,
the component got renamed to 'pci_audio_drv' to reflect its bus connection.

While at it, the execution flow of the component got adapted. The kernel
code should have been executed within the context of the main task like it
is done in the DDE Linux drivers. The initial port of the HDA driver,
however, called the code directly from within the session as there was no
immediate reason to use a task context because suspending the execution was
not needed. When using USB devices, that is no longer possible as we have
to suspend the execution during the execution of the kernel code. So we pass in
the audio data and schedule the kernel.

The above mentioned changes are mostly preliminary clean-up work for the
upcoming support of USB audio devices.

Furthermore, we implemented timeout handling in the driver and use Genode's
timeout framework API to schedule timeouts and for providing the current time.
For now there is only one timeout - the unsolicited azlia codec event -
and therefore the timeout queue consists of solely one timeout object.
Those events are important for detecting plugged in headphones.

Supporting headphones was further refined by accounting for the situation
where the driver is started while headphones are already plugged in and the
mixer accordingly needs to be configured accordingly. In particular, on the
Fujitsu S938 the driver lacked the proper quirk for switching between the
internal and external microphone.

In addition to the changes to the audio driver component, the behaviour
of the audio mixer was changed with regard to handling the configuration
of a new session. The mixer now applies the settings already stored in its
configuration to new sessions instead of only reporting them. In case of
Sculpt, where an existing launcher already contains a valid config
that allows for setting the volume levels appropriately for known sessions
prior to establishing the connection.


Retiring the monolithic USB driver
==================================

With [https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/18.08#Decomposed_USB_stack - release 18.08],
a componentized USB stack got introduced next to our time-tested monolithic USB
driver. With the current release, the driver manager as used by Sculpt OS switched to use the new
USB stack in order to benefit from the de-composition and from more supported
USB devices. The monolithic driver was still based on an older DDE-Linux
revision compared to the componentized version. This step paves the ground
to retire the monolithic USB driver with the next Genode release and will
improve the number of supported USB devices with the upcoming Sculpt OS release.


Platforms
#########

HWP support on PC hardware
==========================

Intel CPUs features Speed Shift respectively Hardware p-state (HWP)
functionality in order to balance CPU frequency and voltage for performance and
power efficiency. Up to now, the UEFI firmware of the notebooks we worked with,
selected or made it selectable in the UEFI configuration to specify the desired
behaviour, e.g. optimize for performance or power efficiency.

With a newer notebook we faced the issue that either the fan run too long
after some load and/or the perfomance of the CPUs were too bad. Finding a well
working sweetspot seems not easy. Based on the experience we investigated how
the Intel HWP feature can be set and configured. After some experiments we
achieved to run the fan shorter hearable and receiving better performance by
tweaking the Intel HWP settings.

However, changing the Intel HWP setting requires to apply it in
the priviledge mode on all available CPUs. Since Genode supports several
kernels, it would require to modify all kernels or the feature would be
solely available to one kernel. We selected the third option, actually.

On x86 we use the tools from the
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/18.08#New_Intel_Microcode_update_mechanism - Morbo probject, e.g. bender and microcode],
to run code before the kernels are booted. The job of the tools are to scan,
enable or apply changes to the CPUs and chipset, which are not required
to change during runtime. We came to the conclusion, that the named bootstrap
tools are good place to apply such one time Intel HWP settings for the moment.

During the course of adding the Intel HWP functionallity, we merged the
microcode functionality into the bender tool. That means, that you may
start before the kernel bender and apply the optional options like
microcode and intel_hwp. A typical generated grub2 configuration by using
both options would look like this:

| insmod multiboot2
| insmod gzio
| multiboot2 /boot/bender bender microcode intel_hwp
| module2    /boot/micro.code micro.code"
| module2    /boot/hyperivosr hypervisor ...
| module2    /boot/image.elf.gz image.elf ...


NOVA microhypervisor
====================

The IOMMU is a hardware feature to protect operating systems, e.g., Genode,
against misbehaving devices and/or corresponding device drivers. The feature
is supported on x86 since the
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/13.02#DMA_protection_via_IOMMU - 13.02 release]
and described in the release notes. Up to now, this feature is solely supported
for Intel hardware, in particular CPUs and chipsets supporting Intel VT-d.

With this release, we add support for AMD's IO-MMU variant to the Genode framework
and the NOVA kernel being the first one out of the supported microkernels.
Being conceptionally equivalent, the actual implementation for AMD differs of
Intel unsurprisingly. In order to add the support, a new IO-MMU interface
abstraction for accommodating both versions - Intel and AMD - got added to the
NOVA kernel.
Further, the lookup of the available IO-MMUs required to walk different ACPI
tables than for Intel and another page table format for the IO-MMU had to be
added. On the Genode framework side, only very few changes were necessary,
namely the detection of the IO-MMU feature by parsing the ACPI tables in
Genode's ACPI driver and the ported Intel ACPICA component.

The change has been already successfully tested on various Ryzen desktops
and notebooks on a backported Sculpt 20.08 branch.
