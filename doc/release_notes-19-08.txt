Consolidation of the C runtime and Noux
#######################################

On our [https://genode.org/about/road-map#August_-_Release_19.08 - road map],
we vaguely hinted at our plan for the "consolidation" of the noux runtime,
which is actually meant as a polite way of saying that we are going to
remove it. We introduced the
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/11.02#Noux_-_an_execution_environment_for_the_GNU_userland - Noux runtime]
in 2011 as way to execute command-line-based GNU software directly on
Genode. It has served us well over the years and is - in fact - a crucial
ingredient of Sculpt OS and other system scenarios such as the Genodians.org
web server. Noux supplements Genode with two valuable assets, namely
a flexible and expandable virtual file system (VFS) layer, and the implementation
of the
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/12.02#Noux_support_for_fork_semantics - Unix way]
to spawn applications ('fork' and 'execve').

In the
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/17.02#Enhanced_VFS_infrastructure - meantime],
noux' VFS implementation has become independent from the noux runtime and
is now prominently employed by Genode's C runtime and the VFS server
component. Genode's C runtime became more and more complete, alleviating
the use of noux as POSIX compatibility layer except for programs that
depend on a working implementation of 'fork' and 'execve'.

The current release fills this remaining gap in Genode's C runtime by
providing 'fork', 'execve', and cousins such as 'wait4' and 'getpid' as
regular parts of the libc. This will eventually make noux redundant.

Note that this change does *NOT* make Genode reliant on POSIX.
the C runtime including the Unix features are entirely optional.

As one stepping stone of this undertaking, noux applications, which had
previously be compiled for noux, have become binary compatible with the
regular C runtime. So one can run programs like 'bash' directly as
Genode component without any friction.

There are a few collateral improvements of Genode's dynamic linker and the C
runtime on the account of the new 'fork' and 'execve' implementation. E.g., in
addition to the already supported 'stdin', 'stdout', and 'stderr'
configuration, the libc can be instructed to initialize arbitrary file
descriptors as follows:

! <config>
!   ...
!   <libc ...>
!     <fd id="3" path="/dev/log" writeable="yes" readable="no" seek="10"/>
!     ...
!   </libc>
! </config>

The libc-based implementation of 'fork' and 'execve' can be tried out via
the new _ports/run/bash.run_ script. Note that there are still a number of
limitations such as the lack of signal and ioctl handling. Pipes are not
supported, and shebangs ('!#') are not interpreted yet. That said, once those
missing pieces come into place, we can fade out the use of noux within Genode.


64-bit ARM and NXP i.MX8
########################

64-bit ARM support in our custom base-hw kernel
===============================================

By introducing rudimentary Raspberry Pi 3 support on top of the Fiasco.OC
kernel in the last release, the first ARM 64-bit support entered the Genode OS
framework. We pursued the ARM 64-bit path and introduce support for Raspberry Pi
3 as well as the i.MX8 evaluation kit (EVK) this time using our own base-hw
kernel.

Noteworthy additions in the base-hw kernel are support for the AARCH64 system
level architecture, and the use of the modern GIC v3 interrupt controller on top
of the i.MX8 EVK board. Minor changes had to be made to the page-table
implementation of ARMv7 with Large Physical Address Extension (LPAE) to re-use
it for ARMv8. Moreover, the TLB maintainance kernel internal API needs to be
changed slightly for all ARM platforms.

Currently, the Raspberry Pi 3 platforms gets regularily tested using Qemu.
In contrast we use the i.MX8 EVK physical hardware to test this platform.
Both platforms are driven with a single cpu core only for the moment.

Clipboard
=========

Genode introduced a principle copy-and-paste mechanism already four years ago
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/15.11#Copy_and_paste].
However, originally created as a part of the technology demo, the mechanism
remained unused in our day to day work with Genode. This changed now. We
took the integration of copy-and-paste support in Sculpt OS as an opportunity
to revive and refine the existing mechanism and supplement it with the
features needed to make it practical for daily use.

We believe that the result aligns ease of use nicely with security.
The concept is described in a dedicated article at Genodians.org:
[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2019-07-03-copy-paste].

On a technical level, the existing clipboard component received a new
option that allows for dynamic information-flow policies based on
user interactivity (keyboard focus, activity).
When setting the config attribute 'match_labels="yes"', the clipboard
performs plausibility checks for copy and paste operations against the
focus of the nitpicker GUI server. The clipboard policy - including
information-flow policies - has become reconfigurable.

To make window-manager clients compatible with the clipboard's dynamic
policy, the window manager got enhanced with the ability to proxy the
interaction with the clipboard.

GUI clients in turn - in particular the graphical *terminal* - became able
to interact with the clipboard.
With the '<config>' attribute 'copy="yes"' specified, the terminal allows
the user to select text to be reported to a "clipboard" report. The selection
mode is activated by holding the left shift key. While the selection mode
is active, the text position under mouse pointer is highlighted and the
user can select text via the left mouse button. Upon release of the mouse
button, the selection is reported.
Vice versa, with the '<config>' attribute 'paste="yes"' specified, the
terminal allows the user to paste the content of a "clipboard" ROM session
to the terminal client by pressing the middle mouse button.

Finally, we integrated those new abilities into Sculpt OS and to several
installable packages, including virtual machines, the noux-system package,
and graphical Qt5-based applications.


Enhanced SSH terminal
=====================

This release paves the way for remotely managing Genode devices over SSH.
Until now, only interactive SSH sessions were supported. It is now possible to
execute commands from a remote SSH client.
E.g., 'ssh noux@localhost -p 5555 "ls -hal /bin/'. For non-interactive
sessions, ssh_terminal requires a helper component. This component is
responsible to create the environment for the command to run in. You can find
an example for such a component in _gems/src/test/exec_terminal_.
It starts noux in a sub init and executes the provided command inside of it.
The new _ssh_exec_channel.run_ script gives a demonstration on how this
feature can be used.

This work is a contribution by [https://gapfruit.com - Gapfruit]. Thanks
for this great new feature!


Storage-stack improvements
==========================

The desire of one Genode developer to exchange data via Iomega ZIP drives
between an Atari Falcon and Sculpt OS called for a number of small
improvements across several components of the storage stack.

First, the USB-block driver has been changed to exit on an initialization
failure instead of waiting for another (supported) device. This change enables
the Sculpt manager to detect such conditions and release the USB device
hardware by removing the driver component. Such a failed initialization may
happen with exotic USB-storage devices such as ZIP drives. With the device
released, however, it can be assigned as to a virtual machine to access it
using a guest OS with a broader support of devices.

Second, the USB-block driver received new support for issuing the
SCSI START-STOP command at initialization time, thereby overcoming the
ZIP-drive initialization failure.

Third, we enhanced the part-block component with the ability to parse AHDI
partition schemes and detect the GEMDOS variant of FAT as used by Atari TOS.

Fourth, we enabled the Rump VFS plugin to access GEMDOS file systems. The
GEMDOS variant is supported by NetBSD's "msdos" file-system driver. However,
it must explicitly be enabled by a mount flag. Hence, we added the principle
ability for passing mount flags to NetBSD file-system drivers and enabled the
MSDOSFSMNT_GEMDOSFS flag based on the VFS plugin's config attribute
'gemdos="yes"'.

With these changes in place, data can now be exchanged directly between
Atari-formatted disks and Sculpt OS. That said, advanced use cases such as
media changes at runtime are not covered yet.


Updated Ada/SPARK runtime
=========================

Genode's Ada/SPARK runtime is developed and maintained by
[https://componolit.com - Componolit]. Thanks for this excellent
collaboration!

The updated Componolit Ada runtime 1.1.0 increases the proof coverage and
cleans up the source code structure. SPARK mode is now enabled wherever
possible and unneeded abstractions have been removed. Furthermore, the 64-bit
addition and subtraction have been proven to be free of runtime errors.
As a new feature, the runtime now supports the use of inline assembly in Ada.

The removal of unneeded features such as the incomplete threading support for
the secondary stack has greatly reduced the runtime's complexity while keeping
the current functionality available.
Also GNAT.IO has been removed as its implementation was incomplete and
complex. A simpler replacement has been introduced with
'Componolit.Runtime.Debug'.

Unrelated to Genode, the runtime now supports [https://muen.sk/ - Muen] and
the API/ABI of the runtime has been separated from the GNAT ABI.

Virtualization
==============

As follow up of Genode's work on the 
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/19.05#Kernel-agnostic_virtual-machine_monitors - kernel agnostic virtual monitor interface]
on x86, we added with this release principle support to run our port of
Virtualbox on Genode/Fiasco.OC. We write -principle- support, since we managed
to get the VMM running with Fiasco.OC, but unfortunately not all required
features by the VMM are available by the Fiasco.OC kernel, e.g. guest FPU
registers, PDPTE registers and task-priority support. In practice this means,
that the VMs with Windows and Linux come up to a certain point, but will fail
later whenever the guest state run out of synchronization between
VMM and hardware. In contrast, the Seoul VMM runs fine on Fiasco.OC since it
requires not the mentioned missing features.

Main working items had been the completion of transfer of the available guest
registers and control flow synchronization improvements between VMM and Fiasco.OC
kernel. Additionally, the usage of priorities for the Virtualbox pthreads in
the VMM had to been disabled. Finally, some tests for Virtualbox with
Genode/Fiasco.OC got enabled for nightly regular testing.

    autopilot: support arch-specific build directories
    
    Replace the notion of board-specific platforms by clear definition
    architecture and board.
    
    Also added new command line switch for "targets"
    
      -t <target>         test target as triple of architecture-board-kernel,
                          e.g., arm_v7a-pbxa9-hw
    
    Related to #3316
    Fixes #3417
