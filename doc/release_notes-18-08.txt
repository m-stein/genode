    sculpt: manage leitzentrale window layout
    
    With this patch, the sculpt manager takes over the role the window
    layouter of the leitzentrale, which eliminates the need to manually
    position and size the inspect window.

    Sculpt: route input_filter chargen requests to config_fs_rom
    
    The top-level Sculpt configuration is routing ROM requests for chargen
    files from the input_filter to the parent, and this prevents new chargen
    files to specified, for instance the German or Workman layout. Route ROM
    requests with a combination of label_prefix and label_suffix patterns to
    the config_fs_rom component, allowing the input_filter to be dynamically
    reconfigurable.

    sculpt: condition checks for running components
    
    By caching the state reports generated by the runtime init, the sculpt
    manager becomes able to quickly check for the presence of components. So
    we can apply routing-dependency checks not only prior starting
    components but also while components are running.

    sculpt: runtime view
    
    This patch adds a graph of the current runtime state to the
    leitzentrale. The topology of the graph depends on the first routing
    rule of each component. For this reason, the patch re-orders routing
    policies to make the most important route the first in the list.
    
    The user can switch between the runtime view and the inspect window
    by clicking on the corresponding menu dialogs. E.g., a click on the
    storage dialog reveals the inspect window.

Device drivers
##############

Linux device-driver environment based on kernel version 4.16.3
==============================================================

We updated our DDE Linux version from 4.4.3 to 4.16.3 to support newer
Intel wireless cards as well as Intel HD graphics devices. Since there
were some changes to the Linux internal APIs we had to adapt the Linux
emulation environment. We managed to do that in a way that still makes
it possible to keep using the old Linux version for certain drivers like
the FEC network driver and the TCP/IP stack. Those will be updated later
on. Further more, some drivers received additional features while updating
the code base.


Updated and enhanced Intel framebuffer driver

    intel_fb: add support to change brightness


Updated and reworked Intel wireless driver
==========================================

In addition to updating the iwlwifi driver's code base that now comes with
support for 8265 as well as 9xxx devices, the WPA supplicant code was also
updated to a recent git version that contains critical fixes for issues like
the KRACK exploit.

Since the updated driver requires newer firmware images which are not as easily
accessible as the old ones, as well we now provide the appropiate images
ourselves:

[https://github.com/cnuke/dde_linux_firmware - Firmware images for DDE Linux]

We took the opportunity to also rework the wifi_drv's configuration interface.
The old driver used the 'wpa_supplicant.conf' POSIX config file interface
as configuration mechanism. Unfortunatly, this implementation detail became
apparant to the user of the driver because a file system that provided a place
to store the file had to be configured. For this reason, we now make use of the
CTRL interface of the supplicant and implemented a Genode specific backend.
In this context we changed the structure of the configuration of the driver.

The driver still reports its current state but the report is now simply called
'state' instead of 'wlan_state'. At the moment SSIDs are provided verbatim in
the report and are not sanatized. SSIDs that contain unusal characters like '"'
and the NUL byte will lead to unparsable reports. This is also true for the
'accesspoints' report that now also is simply called 'accesspoints' instead of
'wlan_accesspoints'.

The main configuration was moved from the common '<config>' node to
a new ROM called 'wifi_config'. In doing so we cleanly seperated the wireless
configuration from the component's internal configuration like the libc or VFS
settings that are not supposed to change during the components lifetime. The
new 'wifi_config' configuration looks as follows:

!<wifi_config connected_scan_interval="30" scan_interval="5">
!  <accesspoint ssid="Foobar" protection="WPA2" passphrase="allyourbase"/>
!</wifi_config>

The type of the top node is ignored by the driver and can be chosen freely.
The 'connected_scan_interval' specifices the timeout after which the driver
will request a new scan of the existing accesspoints while being already
connected to one accesspoint. This setting influence the frequency at which
the driver will make a roaming decision within the network (SSID). The
'scan_interval' attribute specifices the timeout after which a new scan
request will be executed while stilling trying to find a suitable accesspoint.
In addition to those attributes there is also 'use_11n' that, however, only
be evaluated once on start-up to enable or rather disable 11N support within
the iwlwifi module. It cannot be toggled at run-time. Furthermore there are
various verbosity attributes like 'verbose' and 'verbose_state'. If either of
those is set to yes, the driver will print diagnostic messages to the LOG
session. They are toggable at run-time. It is now also possible to temporarily
suspend the radio activity of the wireless device by setting the 'rfkill'
attribute to 'yes'. This will basically disable all connectivity and can
be freely set at run-time.

The '<accesspoint>' node replaces the previously used '<selected_network>'
node. The SSID of the preferred network is set via the 'ssid' attribute. Like
the SSID in the driver's reports its value is copied verbatim and at the
moment there is no way to express or escape non alphanumeric characters.
The type of protection of the network is set via the 'protection' attribute.
Valid values are 'WPA' and 'WPA2'. The alphanumeric password is set via the
'passphrase' attribute. Setting a PSK directly is not supported for now.
The configuration can contain more than one 'accesspoint' entry. In this case
the driver will chose the network with the best quality from the list. To
prevent the driver from auto-connecting to a network, the 'auto_connect'
attribute can be set to 'false'. The 'bssid' attribute may be used in addition
to the 'ssid' attribute to select a specific accesspoint within one network.

There is no backwards compatibility for the old configuration format. Users
are advised to change their components.

As an unfortunate regression some if not all 6xxx cards will not work
properly. We are working on fixing this issue.

    input/ps2: drop fake right-shift scancodes
    
    Seen on X250
    
    Description from https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-1.html
    
      The ten grey keys Insert, Home, PgUp, Delete, End, PgDn, Up, Left,
      Down, Right are supposed to function regardless of the state of Shift
      and NumLock keys. But for an old AT keyboard the keypad keys would
      produce digits when Numlock was on or Shift was down. Therefore, in
      order to fool old programs, fake scancodes are sent: when LShift is
      down, and Insert is pressed, e0 aa e0 52 is sent; upon release of
      Insert e0 d2 e0 2a is sent. In other words, a fake LShift-up and fake
      LShift-down are inserted.

Base framework and OS-level infrastructure

Streamlined ELF-binary loading
==============================

; @nfeske

commit 4b46abf813b801bc9d1555795fc5b9ce13c588ee
Author: Norman Feske <norman.feske@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 4 18:48:04 2018 +0200

    base: rm first-class support for static binaries
    
    This patch removes the detection of statically linked executables from
    the base framework. It thereby fixes the corner cases encountered with
    Sculpt when obtaining the binaries of the runtime from the depot_rom
    service that is hosted within the runtime.
    
    Statically linked binaries and hybrid Linux/Genode (lx_hybrid) binaries
    can still be started by relabeling the ROM-session route of "ld.lib.so"
    to the binary name, pretending that the binary is the dynamic linker.
    This can be achieved via init's label rewriting mechanism:
    
      <route>
        <service name="ROM" unscoped_label="ld.lib.so">
          <parent label="test-platform"/> </service>
      </route>
    
    However, as this is quite cryptic and would need to be applied for all
    lx_hybrid components, the patch adds a shortcut to init's configuration.
    One can simply add the 'ld="no"' attribute to the <start> node of the
    corresponding component:
    
      <start name="test-platform" ld="no"/>
    
    Fixes #2866


NIC-router support for multiple uplinks
=======================================

; @m-stein

commit 49a3a0e0d096af943d661294eee3f526c081ebc7
Author: Martin Stein <martin.stein@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Tue Jun 5 18:31:40 2018 +0200

    nic_router: multiple uplinks
    
    Introduce the uplink tag:
    
    ! <config>
    !    <uplink label="wifi"  domain="uplink">
    !    <uplink label="wired" domain="wired_bridge">
    !    <uplink               domain="wired_bridge">
    ! <config/>
    
    For each uplink tag, the NIC router requests a NIC session with the
    corresponding label or an empty label if there is no label attribute.
    These NIC sessions get attached to the domain that is set in their
    uplink tag as soon as the domain appears. This means their lifetime is
    not bound to the domain. Uplink NIC sessions can be safely moved from
    one domain to another without being closed by reconfiguring the
    corresponding domain attribute.
    
    Attention: This may render previously valid NIC router configurations
    useless. A domain named "uplink" doesn't automatically request a NIC
    session anymore. To fix these configurations, just add
    
    ! <uplink domain="uplink"/>
    
    or
    
    ! <uplink label="[LABEL]" domain="uplink"/>
    
    as direct subtag of the <config> tag.

    nic_router: act as ICMP Echo server
    
    The ICMP-Echo-server functionality of the router has the following
    configuration attributes (default values shown):
    
    ! <config icmp_echo_server="yes">
    !    <domain icmp_echo_server="yes" ... />
    ! </config>
    
    The icmp_echo_server attribute configures whether the router answers ICMP Echo
    requests that address the router. The <config> value affects all domains
    without a <domain> local value.

    nic_router: verbose_packet_drop attribute
    
    The log messages covered by verbose_packet_drop were previously
    configured by the verbose attribute. This isn't the case anymore. Now,
    you can configure them as follows:
    
    ! <config verbose_packet_drop="no" ... >
    !     <domain verbose_packet_drop="no" ... />
    ! <config/>
    
    The new attribute determines whether to log each packet drop and the
    rational behind it. The <config> value affects all domains without a
    <domain> local value.

    LwIP VFS plugin

    implementing the socket_fs interface. Rather than use LwIP's socket
    emulation layer this plugin interfaces directly to LwIP raw API and is
    single threaded.

Simplified DNS handling of libc-using components
================================================

We overhault the way the libc will lookup up the DNS server. Instead of simply
accessing the commonly used '/etc/resolv.conf' file it will now use the
file given by the 'nameserver_file' attribute to get the DNS nameserver
address. It defaults to '/socket/nameserver' which is the common location when
using the lxip or lwip VFS plugin. As a constraint the libc will read the first
line and expects the nameserver address without any keywords in front of it.

    Plugin for importing VFS content
    
    This new vfs_import plugin allows a VFS instance to be populated during
    construction using a sub-VFS configured in an '<import>' configuration
    node. This allows the ram_fs File_system server to be replaced by the
    VFS server by reimplementing the ram_fs 'content' feature.  At the
    moment the copying of symlinks is not enabled, and the resources
    obtained by the import file-system may not be freed after the import is
    finished.

    Remove COW VFS plugin
    
    The COW plugin provided only partial copy-on-write semantics and had
    problems detecting recursive requests. Conversely, the import plugin has
    much simpler behavior that is easy to test because it mirrors that of
    the ram_fs server.

;    Pdf_view: load arbitrary *.pdf files, input improvements
;    
;    The component is no longer loads from '/test.pdf', the first PDF file
;    found in the root directory of the file-system is loaded automatically.
;    The behavior cannot be overridden by configuration.
;    
;    Feed MuPDF with characters from input events to MuPDF rather than
;    translate raw key codes to ASCII. This enables almost all MuPDF key
;    bindings without the need to maintain a lookup table. Mouse navigation
;    has been enabled as well. To print the key-bindings to log, press '?'.
;    
;    Fix #2859

;    Merge the configuration from raw/pdf_view into the pkg/pdf_view runtime
