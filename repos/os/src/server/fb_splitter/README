EXPERIMENTAL:
This component is a temporary feature and should not be used broadly.

The Framebuffer splitter provides an underlying Framebuffer session to multiple
clients. Normally, Framebuffer drivers allow a single client only. The splitter
simply forwards all requests to the underlying session without further
management except that it serializes them as it has only one entrypoint.
