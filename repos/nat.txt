Final goal: A component that does source NAT with dynamic routing and
destination NAT with static routing.

1) Create a component that does simple port forwarding.
	1.1) Find test that can be easily adapted to act as port forwarding test.
		1.1.1) network_test*: Deprecated, remove
		1.1.2) test-nicbridge_static: Looks good
	1.2) Rename nic_bridge in the test nat 
	1.3) Learn how the bridge works to be able to modify it in a way that it
	     does port forwarding
